bm_DL_4_bit_comparator.v
	Regarding: 
	always @(A or B)
	begin
		if(A == B)
			AeqB = 1;
		else if (A > B)
			AgtB = 1;
		else
			AltB = 1;
	end

	- Odin fills in alternate cases for AeqB, AgtB and AltB where it assigns those to 0. 
		EG: When A != B AeqB is set to 0 by Odin, but maintains its previous value in Modelsim. 	

bm_my_D_latch1.v
	- Incomplete sensitivity list in combination process. Causes ModelSim to ignore a reset signal. 

bm_DL_D_latch.v                 
	Regarding: 
	 always @(D or Clk)
		if (Clk)
			Q = D;	
	- Odin fills in an "else" condition where Q = 0. ModelSim fills in no "else" condition and Q is initially set to x (unknown).
